Parallax
========

I created this in Typescript based on an example I found at http://davegamache.com/parallax/index.html. But when I started digging deeper, I found a great library called Skrollr at https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr, so I don't think I'll need this anymore.

However, who knows. Maybe some time, this will come in handy again. At least it was a fun couple of nights sorting this out ;)
